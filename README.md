# Readytowearit: Created Using Start Bootstrap Creative

[Creative](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-creative) is a one page creative theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). Feel free to follow any of my commits to see changes I have made. Thank you [David Miller](davidmiller.io), for being willing to share.

My site is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and I purchased a domain with [Google Domains](https://domains.google/#/). A wonderfully simple tutorial on how to host your site with these two products can be found [here](https://dev.to/trentyang/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages-1p58).

## About

Ready-to-Wear It provides weekly new arrivals to match a woman's current lifestyle. From work-wear to travel or your first profile in a magazine spread.

## Copyright and License

I obviously don't own any rights to the creative theme. I have not decided which license is best to use for this forked project. I'm happy if anyone finds any of my changes useful. At least fork it so I know it was useful to you :+1:
